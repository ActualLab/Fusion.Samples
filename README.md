Don't know what Fusion is? [You should!](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion) 
Fusion is your #1 partner in crime if you're 
building a real-time app (an online app delivering
some or all updates in real-time) or a high-load app.
Moreover, it plays really well with Blazor and works on MAUI.

Fusion allows you to build fully real-time UIs like this one - 
and it's nearly as easy as if there is no logic related to real-time
updates at all:

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-New!-green" valign="middle"> If you're curious about what Fusion allows you to build, check out [Actual Chat] - a new chat app created to maximize the efficiency of your communication with the modern AI.

- Currently it does what most of other chats do, but also allows you to **talk in chats in real-time**. When you do this, it delivers your voice and its transcription to every person reading or listening, which allows other people to join the conversation as soon as they see its very first words, or read/replay it later.
- There are SSB/WASM, iOS, Android, and Windows clients, with nearly 100% of the code shared among them.
- Free to ask your Fusion-related questions here: https://actual.chat/chat/zu3UA03jvX
- As far as we know, it's one of the most complex Fusion-based apps. The startup behind Actual Chat was founded by Fusion's author.
