    "  * Blazor clients may reference `ActualLab.Fusion.Blazor` instead, which references `ActualLab.Fusion.Client`\n",

    "The list of Fusion packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Core/) -\n",
    "  a collection of relatively isolated abstractions and helpers we couldn't find in BCL.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Generators](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Generators/) - has no dependencies.\n",
    "  It's a Roslyn code generator that \"implements\" generic call interception proxies used by Fusion, ActualLab.Rpc, and CommandR.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Interception](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Interception/) - depends on `ActualLab.Core`.\n",
    "  Implements call interception API used by [ActualLab.Generators].\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Rpc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Rpc/) - depends on `ActualLab.Core`.\n",
    "  An RPC API and protocol that Fusion uses to implement its Compute Service Clients.\n",
    "  It's also the fastest RPC implementation that's currently available on .NET for plain RPC calls and streaming.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Rpc.Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Rpc.Server/) - depends on `ActualLab.Rpc`.\n",
    "  An implementation of `ActualLab.Rpc` server for ASP.NET Core, which uses WebSockets.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Rpc.Server.NetFx](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Rpc.Server.NetFx/) - depends on `ActualLab.Rpc`.\n",
    "  An implementation of `ActualLab.Rpc` server for ASP.NET / .NET Framework 4.X, which uses WebSockets.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.CommandR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.CommandR/) - depends on `ActualLab.Core` and `ActualLab.Interception`.\n",
    "  CommandR is \"[MediatR](hhttps://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) on steroids\" designed to support\n",
    "  not only interface-based command handlers, but also AOP-style handlers written as\n",
    "  regular methods. Besides that, it unifies command handler API (pipeline behaviors and handlers\n",
    "  are the same there) and helps to eliminate nearly all boilerplate code you'd have otherwise.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion/) - depends on `ActualLab.Core`, `ActualLab.Interception`, and `ActualLab.CommandR`.\n",
    "  Nearly everything related to Fusion is there.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.Ext.Contracts](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.Ext.Contracts/) - depends on `ActualLab.Fusion`.\n",
    "  Contracts for some handy extensions (ready-to-use Fusion services) - e.g. Fusion-based authentication is there.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.Ext.Services](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.Ext.Services/) - depends on `ActualLab.Fusion.Ext.Contracts` and `ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework`.\n",
    "  Implementations of extension contracts from `ActualLab.Fusion.Ext.Contracts`.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.Server/) - depends on `ActualLab.Fusion` and `ActualLab.Rpc`.\n",
    "  Basically, Fusion + `ActualLab.Rpc.Server` + some handy server-side helpers.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.Server.NetFx](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.Server.NetFx/) -\n",
    "  .NET Framework 4.X version of `ActualLab.Fusion.Server`.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.Blazor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.Blazor/) - depends on `ActualLab.Fusion`.\n",
    "  Provides Blazor-Fusion integration. Most importantly, there is `StatefulCompontentBase<TState>`,\n",
    "  which allows to create auto-updating components which recompute their state once the data they consume\n",
    "  from Fusion services changes.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.Blazor.Authentication](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.Blazor.Authentication/) - depends on `ActualLab.Fusion.Blazor` and `ActualLab.Fusion.Ext.Contracts`.\n",
    "  Implements Fusion authentication-related Blazor components.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework/) - depends on `ActualLab.Fusion`.\n",
    "  Contains [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) integrations for CommandR and Fusion.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework.Npgsql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework.Npgsql/) -\n",
    "  depends on `ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework`.  \n",
    "  Contains [Npgsql](https://www.npgsql.org/) - based implementation of operation log change tracking.\n",
    "  PostgreSQL has [`NOTIFY / LISTEN`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-notify.html)\n",
    "  commands allowing to use it as a message queue, so if you use this database,\n",
    "  you don't need a separate message queue to allow Fusion to notify peer hosts about\n",
    "  operation log changes.\n",
    "* [ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework.Redis](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework.Redis/) -\n",
    "  depends on `ActualLab.Fusion.EntityFramework`.  \n",
    "  Contains [Redis](https://redis.com/) - based implementation of operation log change tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some other packages, but more likely than not you won't need them. \n",
